# Introduction to the Bank Customer Dataset and Attrition Analysis

- About the Dataset
This dataset provides extensive information about customers of a banking institution, capturing their demographics, financial behaviors, and usage of bank's products and services. It enables us to investigate customer characteristics and behaviors, and most importantly, their attrition status.

- Understanding Customer Attrition
Customer attrition, often referred to as customer churn, is a critical metric in the banking industry. It represents the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity over a given period. High attrition rates could indicate customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and marketing from competitors, or a change in the customer's needs or financial circumstances, among other reasons.

Tracking customer attrition is vital as retaining existing customers is typically cheaper and more efficient than acquiring new ones. Understanding the factors that lead to customer churn can help the bank implement effective customer retention strategies and improve their services, thus enhancing customer loyalty and reducing the cost associated with customer acquisition.

- Approach
In this analysis, we aim to predict customer attrition using machine learning techniques. Our primary objective is to identify the key predictors of churn and build a model that can accurately predict which customers are most likely to churn. We will experiment with different classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to find the model that best suits our data and provides the most accurate predictions.

Our success in prediction will be gauged primarily using f1 score. We chose to use f1 score do to the fact that it may be a better representation of our ability to predict attrition. This is because f1 score takes the average of precision and recall. This average is important because precision can lead to the model only predicting when it is CERTAIN that the member will attrite. This is the worst possible outcome. Recall is how often the model predicts a members attrition to the number of times people actually leave. The porblem here is that you may get a high recall when you predict everyone or close to everyone is going to leave which will give a high recall but you are wasting resources assuming everyone is going to leave. You can think of the difference between the two as precision: how well you hit a target on a dartboard, and recall: how well you recall all of the defective products your company released. F1 taking the average of both minimizes the risk of both unique statistics. In this instance we want a higher f1 score and recall because the risk of losing a member has high costs but not so high that we want to predict everyone. So an f1 score of .7 we will identify as the minimum requirement.

- Steps
Our analysis will proceed in the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will first perform a light EDA to understand the distribution of variables, check for missing data, and observe the relationship between different variables and attrition. This will give us valuable insights into our data and guide our feature selection and engineering efforts.

Feature Selection and Engineering: Based on the insights from EDA, we will select the most relevant features for our model. We may also create new features if necessary.

Model Building and Evaluation: We will then implement different classification models, tune their hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search, and evaluate their performance using our chosen metric (f1 score).

By the end of this analysis, we aim to have a model that can accurately predict customer attrition and help the bank retain its valuable customers.
